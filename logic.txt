# Customer
    There are two types of customer, user and guest

    # HOW IT WORKS
    Once one visits the web app they automatically become a Customer with a default setting as guest

    # Customer fields
    - user: foriegn key ,Blank=true, null=true, ondelete=model.cascade
    - uniqueId: unique 11 digit number | id | timestamp
    - isGuest: default True (Meaning the customer is not registered or don't have an account)
    - date created: automatic
    - last edited: automatic
    - time-zone: automatically generated via the user location (time zone)
    - address: blank= True
    - Phone number: blank= True
    - profilePic: blank= True
    - paymentOptions: many to many fields

    # Users:
    - isGuest in the Customer model will be False
    - user model will be created, user field in the Customer = user created
        # Fields required for the user model
        - username: automatically filled by the uniqueId from the Customer
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - email
        - password 
        - permissions
        - important Dates 'last login, date joined'
