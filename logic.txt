# Users:
- isUser in the Customer model will be True
- user model will be created, user field in the Customer = user created
        # Fields required for the user model
        - username: if isUser = True: automatically filled by the uniqueId from the Customer 
                    else: model creating a user(e.g 'admin','customer')|unique 4 digit number|id| timestamp

        - password 
        - permissions: default = None
        - group: default = Customer
        - important Dates 'last login, date joined'

        # Note: no user can be created independently due to the fact it requires a parameter determining what role / model 

    # Customer
        There are two types of customer, user and guest

        # HOW IT WORKS
        Once one visits the web app they automatically become a Customer with a default setting as guest

        # Customer fields
        - user: foriegn key ,Blank=true, null=true, ondelete=model.cascade
        - uniqueId: 'customer'|unique 4 digit number|id| timestamp
        - isUser: default False (Meaning the customer is not a user or don't have an account)
        - date created: automatic
        - last edited: automatic
        - time-zone: automatically generated via the user location (time zone)

        required isUser
        - address: blank= True
        - Phone number: blank= True
        - profilePic: blank= True
        - paymentOptions: many to many fields
        
        if isUser == True: save required and give access to edit these field
        else autoreset after each purchase and restrict access

    # Admin

        - username: admin|unique 4 digit number|id| timestamp
        ......
        group : Admin
